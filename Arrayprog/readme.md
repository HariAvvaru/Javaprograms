## Program1
Write a program to initialize an integer array and print the sum and average of the array.
## Program2
Write a program to initialize an integer array and find the maximum and minimum value of the array.
## Program3
Write a program to initialize an integer array with values and check if a given number is present in the array or not.
## Program2
Given two non-negative int values, print true if they have the same last digit, such as with 27 and 57. If the number is not found, it will print -1 else it will print the index value of the given number in the array.

**Test Cases:**
-  If the Array elements are {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 90, then the output expected is -1.
-  If the Array elements are {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 56, then the output expected is 3.


- Input: 7 17  --> Output: true
- Input: 6 17  --> Output: false
- Input: 3 113 --> Output: true
