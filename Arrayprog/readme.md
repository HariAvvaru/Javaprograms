## Program1
Write a program to initialize an integer array and print the sum and average of the array.
## Program2
Write a program to initialize an integer array and find the maximum and minimum value of the array.
## Program3
Write a program to initialize an integer array with values and check if a given number is present in the array or not. If the number is not found, it will print -1 else it will print the index value of the given number in the array.

**Test Cases:**
-  If the Array elements are {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 90, then the output expected is -1.
-  If the Array elements are {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 56, then the output expected is 3.
## Program4
Initialize an integer array with ascii values and print the corresponding character values in a single row.
## Program5
Write a program to find the largest 2 numbers and smallest 2 numbers in the given array.
## Program6
Write a program to initialize an array and print them in a sorted order.
## Program7
Write a program to remove the duplicate elements in an array and print the same

**Test Cases:**
- I/P: {12,34,12,45,67,89} --> O/P: {12,34,45,67,89}
## Program8
Write a program to print the sum of the elements of an array following the given below condition. If the array has 6 and 7 in succeeding orders, ignore the numbers between 6 and 7 and consider the other numbers for calculation of sum.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: 10,3,6,1,2,7,9  --> Output: 22 [i.e 10+3+9]
- Input: 7,1,2,3,6  --> Output: 19
- Input: 1,6,4,7,9 --> Output: 10

## Program9
Print a version of the given array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and display the given array or make a new array.

withoutTen([1, 10, 10, 2]) --> [1, 2, 0, 0]
withoutTen([10, 2, 10]) --> [2, 0, 0]
withoutTen([1, 99, 10]) --> [1, 99, 0]

## Program
Given two non-negative int values, print true if they have the same last digit, such as with 27 and 57.
