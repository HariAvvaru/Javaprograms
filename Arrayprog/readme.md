## Program1
Write a program to initialize an integer array and print the sum and average of the array.
## Program2
Write a program to initialize an integer array and find the maximum and minimum value of the array.
## Program3
Write a program to initialize an integer array with values and check if a given number is present in the array or not. If the number is not found, it will print -1 else it will print the index value of the given number in the array.

**Test Cases:**
-  If the Array elements are {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 90, then the output expected is -1.
-  If the Array elements are {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 56, then the output expected is 3.
## Program4
Initialize an integer array with ascii values and print the corresponding character values in a single row.
## Program5
Write a program to find the largest 2 numbers and smallest 2 numbers in the given array.
## Program6
Write a program to initialize an array and print them in a sorted order.
## Program7
Write a program to remove the duplicate elements in an array and print the same

**Test Cases:**
- I/P: {12,34,12,45,67,89} --> O/P: {12,34,45,67,89}
## Program8
Write a program to print the sum of the elements of an array following the given below condition. If the array has 6 and 7 in succeeding orders, ignore the numbers between 6 and 7 and consider the other numbers for calculation of sum.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: 10,3,6,1,2,7,9  --> Output: 22 [i.e 10+3+9]
- Input: 7,1,2,3,6  --> Output: 19
- Input: 1,6,4,7,9 --> Output: 10

## Program9
Print a version of the given array where all the 10's have been removed. The remaining elements should shift left towards the start of the array as needed, and the empty spaces at the end of the array should be 0. So {1, 10, 10, 2} yields {1, 2, 0, 0}. You may modify and display the given array or make a new array.

withoutTen([1, 10, 10, 2]) --> [1, 2, 0, 0]

withoutTen([10, 2, 10]) --> [2, 0, 0]

withoutTen([1, 99, 10]) --> [1, 99, 0]
## Program10
Print an array that contains the exact same numbers as the given array, but rearranged so that all the even numbers come before all the odd numbers. Other than that, the numbers can be in any order. You may modify and print the given array, or make a new array.

evenOdd([1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]) --> [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

evenOdd([3, 3, 2]) --> [2, 3, 3]

evenOdd([2, 2, 2]) --> [2, 2, 2]
## Program11
Given an array of type int, print true if every element is 1 or 4.

only14([1, 4, 1, 4]) --> true

only14([1, 4, 2, 4]) --> false 

only14([1, 1]) --> true
## Program12
Given 2 int arrays, a and b, each length 3, form a new array of length 2, containing their middle elements.

middleway([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]) --> [2, 5]

middleway([7, 7, 7], [3, 8, 0]) --> [7, 8] 

middleway([5, 2, 9], [1, 4, 5]) --> [2, 4]
## Program13
Write a program to reverse the elements of a given 2*2 array. Four integer numbers needs to be passed as Command Line arguments.

**Test Cases:**
- java Sample 1 2 3 --> O/P: Please enter 4 integer numbers
- java Sample 1 2 3 4 --> O/P: 

The given array is :

1 2

3 4
The reverse of the array is :

4 3

2 1
## Program
Given two non-negative int values, print true if they have the same last digit, such as with 27 and 57.
