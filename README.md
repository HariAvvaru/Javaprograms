- if the first character is 's' and second character is 'e' then the output should be e,s
- if the first character is 'a' and second character is 'e', then the output should be a,e
## Program5
Initialize a character variable in a program and

**Test Cases:**
- print 'Alphabhet' if the initialized value is an alphabet
- print 'Digit' if the initialized value is a number
- print 'Special Character', if the initialized value is anything else
## Program6
Write a program to accept gender ("Male" or "Female") and age from command line arguments and print the percentage of interest based on the given conditions.

**Test Cases:**
- If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.2%.
- If the gender is 'Female' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 9.2%.
- If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 1 and 58, the percentage of interest is 8.4%.
- If the gender is 'Male' and age is between 59 and 100, the percentage of interest is 10.5%.
## Program7
Initialize a character variable with an alphabhet in a program. If the character value is in lowercase, the output should be displayed in uppercase in the following format.

**Test Cases:**
- Input: a  --> Output: A
- Input: A  --> Output: a
## Program8
Write a program to receive a color code from the user (an Alphabhet). The program should then print the color name, based on the color code given.

The following are the color codes and their corresponding color names. **R->Red, B->Blue, G->Green, O->Orange, Y->Yellow, W->White.**

If color code provided by the user is not valid then print **"Invalid Code".**
## Program9
